                  <p>
                  This a simple snake like game rendered using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram" target=_blank>Autostereogram</a>.
                  I recently rediscovered Autostereograms and after some research realized that I was always viewing them uing cross pattern, which is incorrect method.
                  After some research I found a <a href="https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/414/li/material/refs/SIRDS-Computer-94.pdf" target=_blank>paper</a> that had algorithm for stereogram generation in C, I decided to try to duplicate this algorithm to see if it would be possible to render moving objects using this technique.
                  Both game and rendering algorithm are implemented in rust and are running on WASM in your browser. Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Gonzih/autostereograms-rs" target=_blank>here</a>.
                  At the moment my main struggle is the fact that I still can't view them correctly, so validating accuracy of my algorithm is only possible with outside help, which slows things drastically.
                  Also im not sure where is my implementation off, but people report some "fuzzines" around the endegs which at the moment I'm not sure how to fix.
                  </p>

                  Big thanks to author of <a href="https://peeinears.github.io/MagicEye.js/" target=_blank>MagicEye.js</a> library which I used to compare my implementation against and used as a base for my canvas manipulation code.
